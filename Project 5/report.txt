a.
The most notable obstacle that was encountered during the writing of this program was finding a method so that the program would not double count stars and planets. This was overcome by replacing each instance of a match for either a star or a planet with a different placeholder character. A second issue was during the comparison of stars, the loops traversing the arrays wouldgo out of index for c-strings of different lengths. This was overcome by finding the length of each c-string beforehand and using the counter for the shorter string.

b.
runOneRound pseudocode:

given no invalid parameters are passed
repeatedly:
	while user input does not match hidden word
		check for c-string length between 4 and 6
			if not output error message
		check for c-string in list of words
			if not output error message
		given above is true:
			increase score by 1
			compares each char in each c-string to corresponding char
				if same replace both char with symbol and increment star
			compares each char in probe with all the chars in hidden word
				if same replace both char with symbol and increment planet
			if not complete match
				output stars and planets and repeat
			else
				return score and break

main pseudocode:

calls getWords from utilities.cpp and checks for loaded words
user input of round number
	checks for positive number of rounds
	given rounds is positive
	repeatedly:
		for n number of rounds
			generate random integer
			find length of keyword corresponding to random integer
			set score equal to output from runOneRound
			set minimum, maximum, and average and output to console
